        <h3>vizER</h3>
        <small>
            vizER is a platform that enables the visualisation of individual genes for evidence of reannotation (full publication: <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/499103v1" title="full publication" target="_blank">here</a>). Complete, annotation-agnostic transcriptome definitions for 41 GTEx tissues can be also downloaded via the vizER webpage. The primary aim of vizER is to facilitate more accurate interpretation of variants and therefore, improve genetic diagnosis.

        <h3>CoExp</h3>
        <small>
            CoExp is a framework for the generation, deployment, sharing and exploitation of co-expression networks as annotation models of genes and their role in transcription. It is a family of R packages that you can separately download from GitHub, but also a Web page in which all models available can be accessed and used for your own research.
            <br /><br />
            The code of the backend is avalible on <a href="https://github.com/juanbot/CoExpNets" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
            The code of the UI is also available on <a href="https://github.com/SoniaRuiz/CoExp_Web" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

        <h3>API</h3>
        <small>
            The RytenLab team also provides a REST API, whereby it is possible to request different methods of the CoExp R framework.
            <br />
            The raw code is available on <a href="https://github.com/SoniaRuiz/RytenLab_API" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
